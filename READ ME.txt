Hello! 
To use the mazeSolver5000.exe please ensure that the needed dependencies are included in the same directory as the executable.
The needed dependencies are:
	freeglut.dll
	glew32.dll
	glfw3.dll
Theoretically only the freeglut.dll is needed on the lab computers, however to be same I've included the others.

For using the mazeSolver5000.exe with the SolverTest program, please have the SolverTest.exe in the same directory as the mazeSolver5000.exe and its dependencies.

Also, the program and tester don't play well together when on the desktop of the lab computers, please run them from the C or H drives.

Thank you for reading!
